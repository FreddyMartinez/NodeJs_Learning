## Test App

This application was built using Node and Express. It also uses [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as db engine and [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) as ORM.

It is tested using Jest and [SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).

It sets the `node_env` variable using windows syntax. When working with multiple OS [cross-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env) library is recommended.
